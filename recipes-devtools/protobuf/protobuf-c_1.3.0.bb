SUMMARY = "Protocol Buffers - structured data serialisation mechanism"
DESCRIPTION = "This is protobuf-c, a C implementation of the Google Protocol Buffers data \
serialization format. It includes libprotobuf-c, a pure C library that \
implements protobuf encoding and decoding, and protoc-c, a code generator that \
converts Protocol Buffer .proto files to C descriptor code, based on the \
original protoc. protobuf-c formerly included an RPC implementation; that code \
has been split out into the protobuf-c-rpc project."
